class ProtectFile:
    """A wrapper around a file pointer, protecting it with a lockfile and backups.

    Use
    ---
    It is meant to be used inside a context, where the entering and leaving of a
    context ensures the file protection. The moment the object is instantiated, a
    lockfile is generated (which is destroyed after leaving the context). Attempts
    to access the file will be postponed as long as a lockfile exists. Furthermore,
    while in the context, file operations are done on a temporary file, that is
    only moved back when leaving the context.

    The reason to lock read access as well, is that we might work with immutable
    files. The following scenario might happen: a file is read by process 1, some
    calculations are done by process 1, the file is read by process 2, and the
    result of the calculations are written by process 1. Now process 2 is working
    on an outdated version of the file. Hence the full process should be locked in
    one go: reading, manipulating/calculating, writing.

    An important caveat is that, after the manipulation/calculation, the file
    contents have to be wiped before writing, otherwise the contents will be
    appended (as the file pointer is still at the end of the file after reading it
    in). Unless of course that is the intended result. Wiping the file can be
    achieved with the built-in truncate() and seek() methods.

    Attributes
    ----------
    file       : pathlib.Path
        The path to the file to be protected.
    lockfile   : pathlib.Path
        The path to the lockfile.
    tempfile   : pathlib.Path
        The path to a temporary file which will accumulate all writes until the
        ProtectFile object is destroyed, at which point the temporary file will
        replace the original file. Not used when a ProtectFile object is
        instantiated in read-only mode ('r' or 'rb').
    backupfile : pathlib.Path
        The path to a backup file in the same folder. This is to not lose the file
        in case of a catastrophic crash. This can be switched off by setting
        'backup_during_lock'=False. On the other hand, the option 'backup'=True
        will keep the backup file even after destroying the ProtectFile object. Not
        used when a ProtectFile object is instantiated in read-only mode ('r' or
        'rb'), unless 'backup_if_readonly'=True.

    Examples
    --------
    Reading in a file (while making sure it is not written to by another process):

    >>> from protectfile import ProtectedFile
    >>> with ProtectedFile('thebook.txt', 'r', backup=False, wait=1) as pf:
    >>>    text = pf.read()

    Reading and appending to a file:

    >>> from protectfile import ProtectedFile
    >>> with ProtectedFile('thebook.txt', 'r+', backup=False, wait=1) as pf:
    >>>    text = pf.read()
    >>>    pf.write("This string will be added at the end of the file, \
    ...               however, it won't be added to the 'text' variable")

    Reading and updating a JSON file:

    >>> import json
    >>> from protectfile import ProtectedFile
    >>> with ProtectedFile(info.json, 'r+', backup=False, wait=1) as pf:
    >>>     meta = json.load(pf)
    >>>     meta.update({'author': 'Emperor Claudius'})
    >>>     pf.truncate(0)          # Delete file contents (to avoid appending)
    >>>     pf.seek(0)              # Move file pointer to start of file
    >>>     json.dump(meta, pf, indent=2, sort_keys=False))

    Reading and updating a Parquet file:

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> from protectfile import ProtectedFile
    >>> with ProtectedFile(mydata.parquet, 'r+b', backup=False, wait=1) as pf:
    >>>     data = pd.read_parquet(pf)
    >>>     data['x'] += 5
    >>>     pf.truncate(0)          # Delete file contents (to avoid appending)
    >>>     pf.seek(0)              # Move file pointer to start of file
    >>>     data.to_parquet(pf, index=True)

        Parameters
        ---------
        wait : float, default 1
            When a file is locked, the time to wait in seconds before trying to
            access it again.
        backup_during_lock : bool, default False
            Whether or not to use a temporary backup file, to restore in case of
            failure.
        backup : bool, default False
            Whether or not to keep this backup file after the ProtectFile object
            is destroyed.
        backup_if_readonly : bool, default False
            Whether or not to use the backup mechanism when a file is in read-only
            mode ('r' or 'rb').
        check_hash : bool, default True
            Whether or not to verify by hash that the move of the temporary file to
            the original file succeeded.
        max_lock_time : float, default None

            lockfile. This is to avoided crashed accesses locking the file forever.
